This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset, which contains information about restaurants, their ratings, and customer reviews in India. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains data from various cities in India.
As the demand for restaurant food in Bengaluru continues to increase, it has become increasingly difficult for new establishments to compete with established ones. This project aims to explore the factors that affect the establishment of different types of restaurants in Bengaluru, and to provide insights on the popular cuisines and locations for restaurant-goers in the city.

Using the Zomato dataset, we will analyze various factors such as the location, theme, and approximate price of food, as well as the demographics of different localities, to determine which types of cuisines are most popular in certain areas of the city. By understanding these trends, we can help new restaurants better cater to the needs and preferences of their target audience, and ultimately enhance their chances of success in the competitive restaurant industry.

Through this project, we hope to provide valuable insights for restaurant owners and investors, as well as for foodies who are seeking the best dining experiences in Bengaluru. This analysis can be used to inform business decisions, marketing strategies, and menu offerings, and can ultimately contribute to the growth and diversity of the restaurant industry in the city.

This notebook will walk you through a thorough data analysis of the Kaggle dataset for Zomato Bengalore Restaurants. The purpose of this project is to provide decision-makers the ability to make choices while considering data regarding eateries in Bengalore. Hence, we can:
